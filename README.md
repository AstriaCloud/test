To install the Netgear A1600 Wi-Fi adapter driver on Debian 12, follow these steps:

### 1. Check for Driver Support
First, verify if your Netgear A1600 Wi-Fi adapter is recognized by the system:

```bash
lsusb
```

Look for a line that corresponds to your Wi-Fi adapter. It should show something like:

```
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 0846:9052 NetGear, Inc.
```

### 2. Install Necessary Packages
Ensure you have the necessary packages installed for building drivers:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential dkms git
```

### 3. Download the Driver Source
The Netgear A1600 (Broadcom BCM4360) driver might not be included directly, so you can use the Broadcom driver package:

```bash
sudo apt install broadcom-sta-dkms
```

### 4. Load the Driver
Load the driver module:

```bash
sudo modprobe wl
```

### 5. Verify Installation
Check if the Wi-Fi adapter is recognized and the driver is loaded:

```bash
iwconfig
```

You should see an entry for a wireless interface, typically named `wlan0` or similar.

### 6. Configure Wi-Fi Connection
Use a network manager (like `NetworkManager`) to configure your Wi-Fi connection, or use `wpa_supplicant` for a manual setup.

### Troubleshooting
If the above steps do not work, you can try manually building and installing the driver from source:

1. **Download Broadcom Driver Source Code**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aanousakis/rtl8812AU.git
   cd rtl8812AU
   ```

2. **Build and Install the Driver**:
   ```bash
   make
   sudo make install
   sudo modprobe 8812au
   ```

3. **Reboot the System**:
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

After rebooting, check if the Wi-Fi adapter is working using `iwconfig` again.

By following these steps, you should be able to install and configure the Netgear A1600 driver on Debian 12.
